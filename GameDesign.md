Baller Flow ‚Äì Game Concept
Game Type: Side-scrolling physics platformer
Platform: Browser-based (Next.js + TypeScript, using Phaser.js)
Theme: Cosmic/Futuristic

Core Concept
Baller Flow is a momentum-based side-scrolling platformer where players control an energy ball through a cosmic landscape. Progress through each level by maintaining momentum and mastering physics-based movement from left to right, with the camera following your progress.

Gameplay Mechanics

1. Core Movement ‚Äì Momentum Based
   Player-controlled horizontal movement (A/D or ‚Üê/‚Üí)
   Camera follows player smoothly as they move right
   Boost jumps with SPACE for vertical movement
   Momentum builds with consistent movement
   Wall-jumps and slopes maintain flow

2. Environment Interaction
   Platform types:

   - Solid platforms for regular bouncing
   - Boost pads that maintain momentum
   - Sloped surfaces for rolling
   - Wall-jump surfaces
   - Moving platforms that require timing

3. Trick System ‚Äì Flow Based
   Tricks build with momentum:
   Wall-rides: Maintain speed along walls
   Long jumps: Clear gaps with built-up speed
   Chain jumps: Quick hops between platforms
   Air tricks: Rotate while maintaining forward momentum
   Speed runs: Fast platform clearing

4. Obstacles & Power-ups
   Obstacles:
   - Spike hazards that require precise jumping
   - Moving barriers synchronized with platforms
   - Speed gates that require minimum velocity
     Power-ups:
   - Speed boost: Temporary acceleration
   - Double jump: Extra air control
   - Shield: Protection from one collision

Game Modes

5. Level-Based Progression
   Multiple handcrafted levels with increasing complexity
   Each level has optional challenges and secrets
   Progress unlocks new abilities and cosmetics

6. Time Attack
   Speedrun through completed levels
   Multiple paths for optimization
   Global leaderboards per level

7. Challenge Mode
   Daily/Weekly modified versions of existing levels
   Special conditions (low gravity, extra speed, etc.)
   Compete for high scores

Additional Features

- Responsive camera that follows player movement
- Speed-based particle effects and trails
- Parallax backgrounds that shift with movement
- Dynamic music that builds with player momentum
- Unlockable ball variations with unique physics properties

Level Design Philosophy
‚úÖ Left-to-right progression with backtracking possible
‚úÖ Multiple paths with risk/reward tradeoffs
‚úÖ Momentum-based puzzles and challenges
‚úÖ Strategic placement of boost pads and power-ups
‚úÖ Hidden areas reward exploration

Why This Works for a Browser-Based Game
‚úÖ Familiar platformer controls with unique physics twist
‚úÖ Precise movement and momentum mechanics
‚úÖ Satisfying progression system
‚úÖ Replayability through multiple paths and speedrunning
‚úÖ Perfect for short play sessions with save points
