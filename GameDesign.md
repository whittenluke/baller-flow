Baller Flow ‚Äì Game Concept
Game Type: Arcade-style physics game
Platform: Browser-based (Next.js + TypeScript, using Canvas API or Phaser.js)
Theme: Cosmic/Futuristic

Core Concept
Baller Flow is a high-energy, physics-based arcade game where players control a constantly bouncing energy ball inside a futuristic, neon-lit flow tunnel. The goal is to maintain momentum, avoid obstacles, and chain together high-scoring tricks to maximize the Flow Meter before time runs out.

Gameplay Mechanics

1. Core Movement ‚Äì Controlled Chaos
   The ball bounces automatically at a fixed rhythm.
   Players control left and right movement (A/D or ‚Üê/‚Üí).
   Holding a direction for too long makes the ball slide, requiring careful balance.
2. The Flow Meter ‚Äì Momentum is Key
   Successfully chaining tricks, dodging obstacles, and collecting energy orbs builds the Flow Meter.
   The higher the Flow Meter, the more gravity-defying moves unlock, like mid-air boosts or wall-riding.
   If the Flow Meter depletes (due to hitting obstacles or losing speed), the game ends.
3. Trick System ‚Äì Style Over Speed
   Tricks include:
   Wall-riding: Hug the tunnel walls for bonus points.
   Edge bounces: Skim along platform edges.
   Mid-air flips: Quick flicks of movement at peak bounce height.
   Perfect landings: Land on glowing zones for multipliers.
   Chaining multiple tricks in succession builds combos.
4. Obstacles & Power-ups
   Obstacles:
   Gravity Shifters: Change bounce direction, forcing quick adaptation.
   Breakable Walls: Smash through with high-speed momentum.
   Black Holes: Suck you in unless you escape with a boost.
   Power-ups:
   Speed Burst: Temporary increased movement control.
   Time Freeze: Slows down hazards for a few seconds.
   Score Multiplier: Doubles all points for a short time.
   Game Modes
5. Endless Flow (Main Mode)
   The tunnel extends infinitely, gradually increasing in difficulty.
   Leaderboard ranks players by how long they maintain their Flow Meter before it depletes.
6. Time Attack
   Players have 60 seconds to score as many points as possible.
   Performing tricks extends the timer slightly.
7. Challenge Runs (Daily Challenges)
   Pre-designed tunnel layouts with unique modifiers (e.g., low gravity, constant speed boosts).
   Compete on global leaderboards for special rewards.
   Additional Features
   Cosmic Theme: Neon-style visuals, pulsating backgrounds that react to music.
   Dynamic Music System: Background music intensifies as the Flow Meter builds.
   Leaderboards: Compete for high scores across different modes.
   Unlockable Skins: Customize the energy ball with different trail effects.
   Why This Works for a Browser-Based Game?
   ‚úÖ Simple but Deep Mechanics ‚Äì Easy to pick up, but mastery requires skill.
   ‚úÖ Physics-Based Gameplay ‚Äì Works well with the Canvas API or Phaser.js.
   ‚úÖ Fast Load Times ‚Äì Minimal assets; focus on procedural level generation.
   ‚úÖ Competitive & Replayable ‚Äì Leaderboards and trick-based scoring add long-term appeal.
